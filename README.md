Hi there,

Welcome to my web portfolio. This is a reflection of my journey getting into front-end development.

Making this portfolio is a big step for me personally. I have been struggling a lot with coding and turning mockups into real products.

My first approach was to create the website purely with HTML and CSS. But I still have some troubles making website responsive, that's why I decided to go forward with Bootstrap.

There are many challenges that come across me. It took me a very long time to format the code and find the best way to utilize my design. It is also took a lot of time to find appropriate resources to enhance user experience.

What I did to better my skill is to read a lot of articles and online tutorials. Sometimes I honestly got frustrated but failing is not an option anymore.

There are so many things that I have learnt. There are also many that I have to learn. I will continue to practice and become better everyday.
