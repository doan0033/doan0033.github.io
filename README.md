Hi there,

Welcome to my web portfolio. This is a reflection of my journey getting into front-end development.

Making this portfolio is a big step for me personally. I have been struggling a lot with coding and turning mockups into real products. 

My first approach was to create the website purely with HTML and CSS. But I still have some troubles making website responsive, that's why I decided to go forward with Bootstrap. I first started with a template from Bootstrap, then add my custom design to make it look original. I tried to step up and add Javascript, hell it was hard. I retrieve these code online while I saw a portfolio of a friend and wanted to do the same thing. At some parts when adding Javascript I feel like my code are all messed up because I would have to modified it into my design, it was really frustrated but failing is not an option anymore. 

There are many challenges that come across me. It took me a very long time to format the code and find the best way to utilize my design. It is also took a lot of time to find appropriate resources to enhance user experience. Aside coding the website, github repository really gives me a hard time. It was ok at first, then something happens during my commits and bam! I have to upload file manually because my git cannot upload the code anymore. 

What I did to better my skill is to read a lot of articles and online tutorials. And then I fail, I fail and I fail. This website contain long lines of code (for me so far) honestly I feel like it can be better and simpler (cleaner). But I feel like I have grown a lot. Last year I didn't even thinking of touching Javascript! 

One more thing is that, creating the mockup myself and then coding the website myself really give me an understanding to the UX/UI field and Front-end field. It need balance, I really want my coding skill to improve so I can manipulate the design anyway I want  T^T 

There are so many things that I have learnt. There are also many that I will have to learn. I will continue to practice and become better everyday. One day I want to create a level up version of this Portfolio and be proud.
