From the start of making this web, I have faced a lot of challenge. 

The first challenge is the mental challenge. The vision I had when I made the mockup was to enhance the user experience for the web, since the original website was really bland and simple. I wanted to add more of personality and brand identity to it. So to me, my mock-up was pretty difficult to follow strictly. I chose Bootstrap as the tool to complete this assignment. From my last experience with Bootstrap, I have learned so much more. Using the knowledge of HTML, CSS and in the future - Java Script, using Bootstrap can be so powerful. It will help me so much with my coding journey.

The assignment also led me to a lot of thoughts. Of how can I be more improved, if I had to rely so much on tool like Bootstrap and just using it at merely beginner level, how can I compete with my peers in the industry. This question make me worry, but also became a motivation for me to strive on.

Creating a website was not easy. Especially when you create it from scratch. My goal is to be able to create a website organically one day. The experience from this assignment taught me that, when you design a product, not only that you should focus on the visual, the functionality but also thinking for the back-end coder.
